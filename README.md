**This is a task fo Clear Solutions.**

Plaese note, that there is no database in this appliction, as the task didn't require one, so all data stored in ArrayList in UserController.
In addition to the required functions, there is implemented getAll() fuction in UserController for convenient testing other functions.

There are three classes of tests, each having its purpose:

-UserTests - testing User validation and update function

-UserControllerTests - testing all controller functions

-GlobalExceptionHandlerTests - testing exception handling
