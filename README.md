**This is a task for Clear Solutions.**

Please note, that there is no database in this application, as the task didn't require one, so all data is stored in ArrayList in UserController.
In addition to the required functions, there is an implemented getAll() fuction in UserController for convenient testing of other functions.

There are three classes of tests, each having its purpose:

-UserTests - testing User validation and update function

-UserControllerTests - testing all controller functions

-GlobalExceptionHandlerTests - testing exception handling
